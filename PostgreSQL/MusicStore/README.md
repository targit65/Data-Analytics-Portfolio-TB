I designed and executed SQL queries on Music Store database using PostgreSQL platform to analyze sales and customer data. 
I implemented Joins, CTEs, Aggregations, and Window Functions to calculate monthly sales, top customers, and growth trends. 
These queries were written to analyze the data and generate insights, and (optionally) that such queries could be used in BI dashboards.
Tools: PostgreSQL, SQL.
